\maketitle
\section{Intro}
How does a computer track a face to do stuff like this \textit{[insert Hololive Clips]}.
To awnser that question I'm going to give you basic overview of Neuroinformatics
and implement vtubing software in an hour or so. \\ 

\textit{[Titlecard]} \\ 
First, we are going to take a look at the neurons that make up a neural network.
Perceptrons.
